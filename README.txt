Hi There People !

I have uploaded the Solved files based on the Questions Below !

● WAP to accept two numbers from the user and display their sum
● WAP to accept radius of a Circle from the user and calculate area and circumference
● WAP to accept roll number , grade and percentage as input from the user and display it back
● Write a program that asks the user to enter his/her name and age. Print out a message , displaying the user’s name along with the year in which they will turn 
  100 years old.
● Write a program that asks the user to input 2 integers and adds them . Accept both the numbers in a single line only.
● Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.
● WAP to accept an integer from the user and check whether it is an even or odd
● WAP to accept a character from the user and check whether it is a capital letter or small letter. Assume user will input only alphabets.
● WAP to accept a character from the user and check whether it is a capital letter or small letter or a digit or some special symbol
● WAP to accept 3 integers from the user and without using any logical operator and cascading of relational operators , find out the greatest number amongst them.
● WAP to accept a year from the user and check , whether it is a leap year or not.
● You have to develop a number guessing game.
    Following are the steps needed:
      1. At first , the program will generate a random integer secretly.
      2. Now it will ask the user to guess that number.
      3. If the user guessed it correctly then the program prints “Congratulations! You guessed it right”.
      4. But if the number guessed by the user is larger than the secret number then program should print “Number too large” and , if the number guessed by
         the user is smaller than the secret number then the program should print “Number too small”
      5. This should continue until the user guesses the number correctly or quits.
      6. If the user wants to quit in between he will have to type 0 or negative number.
● Write a program to accept a string from the user and display it vertically but don’t display the vowels in it.
● Write a program to continuously accept integers from the user until the user types 0 and as soon as 0 is entered display sum of all the nos entered before 0
  Note: Modify the previous code so that if the user inputs a negative integer , your program should ignore it.
● Write a program using a for loop to accept a string from the user and display it vertically but don’t display the vowels in it.
● Write a program to accept an integer from the user and display the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
● Write a program to accept an integer from the user and calculate its factorial.
● Write a program to print the following pattern :
    ***
    ***

● Write a program to print the following pattern :
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
● Write a program to print the following pattern :
    ****
    ***
    **
    *
    
● Write a program to accept an integer from the user and display all the numbers from 1 to that number. Repeat the process until the user enters 0.
